            When speaking to a parent recently, she said,
            “I have made it a rule that my kids read every day for an 
            hour. There are no two ways about it. They now do it and it
             is great, but I have noticed that they have stopped asking 
             questions, they have stopped being curious, and they look dull,
              and that bothers me.”

        <p><strong>As I think about it, I feel like there are two fundamental aspects of living—“being” and “doing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;Curiosity, I feel, is a quality of “being.”</strong></p>
