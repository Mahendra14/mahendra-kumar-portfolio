        <h4><strong>Using fibre networks as additional sensors</strong></h4>
        <p>
            There is potentially a solution already in the ground. The sensor networks for smart motorways are already connected via fibre cables and this fibre could be put to use as a sensor in its own right. For fibre owners and installers there is a significant opportunity to offer more value to smart motorway schemes.
        </p>
        <p>There are inherently gaps in the coverage and these gaps are where delays and errors creep in, which in turn increase the risks for drivers. For example, the DfT report highlighted that the camera-based system used to identify broken down vehicles or drivers experiencing issues still takes an average of 17 minutes to spot a vehicle in trouble.</p><p>It then takes a further 17 minutes for a rescue team to arrive on the scene. If a driver is in trouble on a fast-moving motorway, a half hour response time is very obviously a significant risk.</p>
